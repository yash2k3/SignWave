This project is an interactive platform for Indian Sign Language (ISL) that translates real-time gestures into text and speech, supporting multiple Indian languages. With WebRTC integration, users can engage in live sessions with ISL teachers and test their knowledge. The platform's innovative feature of recognizing both facial expressions and hand signs simultaneously offers a more comprehensive and accurate translation experience, making it a powerful tool for communication and learning in the deaf community.
Our platform provides a comprehensive solution for real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) translation into text and speech, supporting multiple Indian languages. It offers users the ability to communicate through gestures, which are instantly translated into text and audio, making it accessible for both deaf and hearing individuals. Additionally, the platform integrates WebRTC for live sessions with teachers, where users can learn ISL and test their skills in real-time. A unique feature of our system is the simultaneous recognition of facial emotions and hand gestures, offering a holistic approach to ISL translation, both for teaching and general communication.
